## Summary 
We present **LES (Latent Ewald Summation)** ([https://github.com/ChengUCB/les](https://github.com/ChengUCB/les)) as a plug-in library designed to add long-range interactions to short-range machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). 

This repository contains the data and scripts used in the study [*A Universal Augmentation Framework for Long-Range Electrostatics in Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials*](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.5c01400).
Here we demonstrate its integration with MLIPs such as **MACE**, **NequIP**, **Allegro**, **CACE**, and **CHGNet**, and provide training scripts and trained models. 
In particular, we provide **MACELES-OFF** model trained on the SPICE dataset using the the [**MACE** package](https://github.com/ChengUCB/mace) developed by the Cheng group, while the [**converted MACELES-OFF**](https://github.com/ChengUCB/les_fit/blob/main/MACELES-OFF/MACELES-OFF_small_converted.model) model is compatible with the current [**MACE** main branch](https://github.com/ACEsuit/mace).

Here you can find MLIP packages **with LES implementation**.

## 📣 Update 
[2025-10] The **`MACELES`** model has been implemented in the main [**MACE** repository](https://github.com/ACEsuit/mace). Example training and evaluation scripts are available in `./MLIPs/MACE-LES-new`.

[2025-12] For the [**MACE** main branch](https://github.com/ACEsuit/mace), one needs to use the [**converted MACELES-OFF model**](https://github.com/ChengUCB/les_fit/blob/main/MACELES-OFF/MACELES-OFF_small_converted.model) (MD5: cc10e937b55e09f05b16dba756e2311b).

## Usage 
Please refer to the specific folder for related scripts and trained MLIPs.
